<h1>Welcome to the ARF's Obsidian Geochemistry Visualization App!<strong><br /></strong></h1>
    <p>This R-Shiny App plots artifact geochemistry values on a biplot against ellipses representing geochemical values from well-characterized obsidian sources.</p>
    <p>Source geochemical data is derived from Neutron Activation Analysis studies conducted by the Missouri University Research Reactor and provided by Mike Glascock for hosting on <a href="https://opencontext.org/projects/8e7fee33-8ec7-4707-910b-6ace9d70d032">this OpenContext Project</a>. The geographical span of the source data is currently limited to the continent of South America.</p>
    <h2><strong>Intended workflow</strong></h2>
        <ol>
        <li>Select obsidian sources in your study region by Country and Source Names.</li>
        <li>Upload artifact data CSV (Comma Separated Values table) under "Data Management". <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arf-berkeley/web_geochemistry/master/peru-south_xrf-siteid.csv">See this file for an example of the expect CSV format</a> derived from a calibrated X-Ray Fluorescence instrument.</li>
        <li>Choose source chemical elements that provide good discrimination between sources in your region. Because these are based on NAA the most promising elements are Rb, Th, and sometimes Sr (when &gt; 50ppm) and Zr when U is low.</li>
        <li>Assign samples to sources by typing source name into the Notes field. Click Download to save the modified table to a local CSV file. [<strong>Note:</strong> <em><strong>the Download feature is not currently working. Workaround: do this step separately</strong></em>]</li>
        </ol>
        <p>For more details on obsidian source chemistry or to download the NAA data directly <a href="https://opencontext.org/subjects-search/?proj=142-andean-geochemistry-visualization-project&amp;prop=oc-gen-cat-object#3/-25.64/-78.05/7/any/Google-Satellite">browse the project records on the OpenContext repository.</a></p>
    <h2>Caveats</h2>
        <p>This workflow involves overlaying XRF artifact data on NAA derived chemical values and there are numerous complications in this comparison with which you should be familiar.</p>
